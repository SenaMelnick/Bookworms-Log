# React Crud API App

## Infomation 

A simple React app mocking a media aggregator site such as Goodreads or Anilist. Uses https://mockapi.io for data and is capable of all four CRUD operations. 

## Known Issues

- App is not entirely mobile responsive, styling will be reworked in the near future to account for this.
- Minor consistency issue with like buttons and chapter counters when switching pages with React Router.
